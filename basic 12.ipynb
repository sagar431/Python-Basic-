    "1. PdfFileReader() should be opened in 'rb' mode (read binary mode) and PdfFileWriter() should be opened in 'wb' mode (write binary mode).\n",
    "2. You can get a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object using the `getPage()` method and passing 4 as the index, since page indexes are zero-based. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n",

    "   with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n",

    "3. The `numPages` variable stores the number of pages in the PDF document. You can access it using the `getNumPages()` method of a PdfFileReader object:\n",

    "4. If a PdfFileReader object's PDF is encrypted with the password 'swordfish', you must call the `decrypt()` method and pass the password as an argument before you can obtain Page objects from it:\n",

    "6. A Paragraph object represents a single paragraph of text in a Word document, while a Run object represents a contiguous run of text within a paragraph that all have the same style. For example, a paragraph might contain several runs of bold or italic text.\n",

    "9. The `bold` variable of a `Font` object can have three different values:\n",
    "   - `True`: The text is bold.\n",
    "   - `False`: The text is not bold.\n",
    "   - `None`: The text's boldness is inherited from the style hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. You can create a Document object for a new Word document by importing the `docx` module and calling its `Document()` constructor:\n",
