    "1. The `re` module in Python is responsible for generating Regex objects.\n",
    "2. Raw strings are used in Regex objects to avoid issues with escape characters, as regular expressions often include many backslashes and other special characters that would otherwise need to be escaped.\n",
    "3. The `search()` method in Python's `re` module returns a `Match` object if a pattern is found in a string, or `None` if no match is found.\n",
    "4. The `group()` method can be called on a `Match` object to retrieve the actual strings that match the pattern. Calling `group(0)` returns the entire match, while calling `group(n)` returns the nth group in the pattern.\n",
    "5. Group zero in the regex `r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)'` covers the entire match. Group 1 covers the first three digits before the hyphen, and group 2 covers the remaining seven digits separated by a hyphen.\n",
    "6. To match real parentheses or periods in a regular expression, they need to be escaped with a backslash. For example, to match a literal period, the pattern `r'\\.'` can be used.\n",
    "7. The `findall()` method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in a string. If the regular expression has no groups, it returns a list of strings. If the regular expression has groups, it returns a list of tuples containing the matched groups.\n",
    "8. The `|` character in regular expressions means \"or\". It allows you to specify alternative patterns to match.\n",
    "9. The `.` character in regular expressions stands for any single character except a newline character.\n",
    "10. In regular expressions, the `+` character means \"one or more occurrences\", while the `*` character means \"zero or more occurrences\".\n",
    "11. `{4}` in a regular expression matches exactly four occurrences of the preceding pattern, while `{4,5}` matches between four and five occurrences of the preceding pattern.\n",
    "12. In regular expressions, the shorthand character class `\\d` matches any digit, `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character (letters, digits, and underscores), and `\\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and newlines).\n",
    "13. The shorthand character classes `\\D`, `\\W`, and `\\S` are the negated versions of `\\d`, `\\w`, and `\\s`, respectively. `\\D` matches any non-digit character, `\\W` matches any non-alphanumeric character, and `\\S` matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "14. `.*?` matches zero or more occurrences of any character (except a newline) in a non-greedy way, while `.*` matches zero or more occurrences of any character in a greedy way.\n",
    "15. To match both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class, the pattern `[0-9a-z]` can be used.\n",
    "16. To make a regular expression case-insensitive, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be passed as the second argument to `re.compile()`.\n",
    "17. The `.` character in regular expressions normally matches any single character except a newline character. If `re.DOTALL` is passed as the second argument to `re.compile()`, the `.` character will match any character, including newlines.\n",
    "18. `numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens')` will return the string `'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'`.\n",
    "19. Passing `re.VERBOSE` as the second argument to `re.compile()` allows you to include comments and whitespace within the regular expression pattern, making it more readable. It does not affect the actual matching behavior of"
