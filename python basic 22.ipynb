    "1. The output of the code will be \"iNeuron\". Here, the function `func()` is defined without any parameters and it prints the value of the global variable `X` which is assigned the string \"iNeuron\". When the function is called, it prints the value of `X`.\n",

    "2. The result of the code will be \"iNeuron\". Here, the function `func()` is defined with a local variable `X` which is assigned the string \"NI!\". When the function is called, it assigns the value \"NI!\" to `X` locally, but the global variable `X` remains unchanged. When `print(X)` is called outside the function, it prints the global variable `X` which is still \"iNeuron\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code will print \"NI\". Here, the function `func()` defines a local variable `X` which is assigned the string \"NI\". When the function is called, it assigns the value \"NI\" to `X` locally, and prints it. However, the global variable `X` remains unchanged. When `print(X)` is called outside the function, it prints the global variable `X` which is still \"iNeuron\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The code will print \"NI\". Here, the function `func()` defines a global variable `X` using the `global` keyword, and assigns it the value \"NI\". When the function is called, it assigns the value \"NI\" to the global variable `X`, which changes its value to \"NI\". When `print(X)` is called outside the function, it prints the updated value of the global variable `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The output of the code will be \"NI\". Here, the function `func()` defines a local variable `X` which is assigned the string \"NI\". Then it defines another function `nested()` which prints the value of `X`. When `nested()` is called inside `func()`, it prints the value of `X` which is \"NI\". Since `nested()` is a nested function inside `func()`, it has access to the local variable `X` defined in `func()`. When `func()` is called outside the function, it does not return any value. When `X` is called outside the function, it prints the global variable `X` which is still \"iNeuron\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. This code will print \"Spam\". Here, the function `func()` defines a local variable `X` which is assigned the string \"NI\". Then it defines another function `nested()` which uses the `nonlocal` keyword to indicate that `X` refers to the variable defined in the enclosing scope of `func()`. When `nested()` is called inside `func()`, it assigns the value \"Spam\" to the variable `X` defined in `func()`. When `func()` is called, it calls `nested()` which changes the value of `X` to \"Spam\", and then `func()` prints the updated value of `X` which is \"Spam\"."
